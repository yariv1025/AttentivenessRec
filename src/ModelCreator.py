from tensorflow import keras

"""
The keras library helps us build our convolutional neural network.
We import a sequential model which is a pre-built keras model where you can just add the layers.
We import the convolution and pooling layers.
We also import dense layers as they are used to predict the labels.
The dropout layer reduces overfitting and the flatten layer expands a three-dimensional vector into a one-dimensional vector.
Finally, we import numpy for matrix operations.

We reshape x_train and x_test because our CNN accepts only a four-dimensional vector.
The value 60000 represents the number of images in the training data,
28 represents the image size and 1 represents the number of channels.
The number of channels is set to 1 if the image is in grayscale.
If the image is in RGB format, the number of channels is set to 3

We build a sequential model and add convolutional layers and max pooling layers to it.
We also add dropout layers in between, dropout randomly switches off some neurons in the network which forces the data
to find new paths. Therefore, this reduces overfitting.
We add dense layers at the end which are used for class prediction(0â€“9).

Compiling the model with a categorical cross entropy loss function,
Adadelta optimizer and an accuracy metric. We then fit the dataset to the model,
i.e we train the model for 12 epochs. After training the model,
we evaluate the loss and accuracy of the model on the test data and print it.
