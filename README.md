# Attention and concentration monitoring system for students in online learning
(Facial Emotion Recognition by Machine Learning)

## About The Project
___

The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global emergency on January 30, 2020 and an epidemic on March 11, 2020. Countries around the world responded to the epidemic by imposing restrictions on flights and gatherings and giving directions to create distance Social, closure, curfew, cancellation of events and closure of all non-essential institutions.
As a result, the virus has had a huge impact on students, lecturers, and educational organizations around the world. The corona plague has caused schools, colleges and universities around the world to close their doors so that students can maintain the rules of social distance. Consequently, the transition from the frontal learning method to online learning was necessary.

The rapid transition from one teaching method to another, together with the unpreparedness of the various institutions are the main cause of the plethora of problems in online learning.
In frontal learning the lecturer has the ability to observe the whole class and read the facial expressions of the students during the lesson and from this to infer the degree of listening in the class. In addition, in frontal learning, the participation and conversation that is created among the students in the class also indicates the degree of concentration of the class, while in online learning, this interaction is impaired.

Solving these challenges is very important, since online learning is going to be a part of our daily routine in the near future, and we must learn and adapt to it so that we can continue to provide education in an effective and efficient way that equals and even transcends frontal learning.

Our system has come to solve these challenges.
